VulnerabilityCheck
==================

The **VulnerabilityCheck** module is limited to a few vulnerabilities that are known to be exploited by various threat groups. The vulnerability checks focus on vulnerabilities that are used for lateral movement or weaknesses which allow an attacker to easily achieve persistence without using any kind of software as backdoor. 
Note: There are vulnerabilities covered by YARA rules and reported in other modules. The YARA rules that detect vulnerabilities start with ``VUL_``. 

Samples
